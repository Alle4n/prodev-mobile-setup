# Mobile Development Environment Setup

## Objective
The goal of this setup is to prepare a reliable mobile development environment using the **Expo Framework for React Native**. Unlike traditional mobile development that relies heavily on emulators, Expo Go allows us to run and test applications directly on physical devices (Android and iOS).  

---

## Requirements
To complete this setup, ensure the following tools are installed:

- **Node.js LTS** (Long-Term Support version)  
- **Visual Studio Code** (recommended IDE)  
- **Operating System:** macOS, Linux, or Windows  
- **Expo Go** installed on your physical device (Android or iOS)  

---

## Why Expo Go?
Mobile development often requires powerful machines to run device emulators. With a wide range of devices (iPhone 7 → iPhone 16 Pro Max, multiple Android variants), maintaining compatibility can be costly.  

**Expo Go** solves this problem by allowing developers to:
- Test apps directly on a physical device  
- Support both Android and iOS  
- Simplify the mobile development workflow
