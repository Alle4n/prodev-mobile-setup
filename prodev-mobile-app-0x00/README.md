# Create Your First Mobile App

## Set Up the Project

Initialize Project

npx create-expo-app@latest .

The . indicates the project should be created in the current directory.

When prompted:

Do you want to move existing files to /app-example instead of deleting them? (Y/n):

Selected Y to preserve existing files.

Modify Home Screen

Opened the file:

app-example/app/(tabs)/index.tsx

Replaced the default text Welcome! with "First App Created".

Run and Test the Application

npx expo start

iOS Devices: Scan the QR code using the Camera app.

Android Devices: Scan the QR code using Expo Go.

Verified that the app displayed "First App Created".

## Reset the Project

npm run reset-project

The script asked whether to move existing files to /app-example; choosing Y preserved previous work.

Cleared caches, reinstalled dependencies, and reset the main folder to a clean Expo project.

### Observations

Resetting the project does not delete previous work when choosing Y.

Dependencies are reinstalled and caches cleared.

Useful to fix environment issues or return to a fresh template.

## Conclusion

The first mobile app was successfully created using Expo Router. The app runs on both Android and iOS devices using Expo Go, and the reset-project script preserves previous work while providing a clean environment for fresh development.

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
